What i need right now is i have inserted all of my lessons plan in the 
tinydb database, right. 
now i need all of this data in pdf file format.
when the user want to learn with Lingo, they might need a lesson text book.
It would help them far better than without textbook.

So, i decided to create a textbook from my tinydb database in a pdf file.
The textbook must be academic style!
can you do that for me?

This is my lesson file 
/home/robinglory/Desktop/Thesis/english_lessons
This is A2 folder style
