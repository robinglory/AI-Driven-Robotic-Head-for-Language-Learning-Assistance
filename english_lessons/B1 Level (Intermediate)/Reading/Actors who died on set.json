      "text": "Steve Irwin, known as “The Crocodile Hunter,” was working on a documentary called “Ocean’s Deadliest” in 2006 off the coast of Queensland, Australia when tragedy struck. While filming a segment about dangerous fish, Irwin approached a stingray – a type of flat fish with long, sharp tails – in shallow water. The stingray felt it was in danger and attacked the man. The fish had used its sharp tail to poke Steve Irwin in the chest, and the pointy part went into his heart. His crew and emergency services tried to save him, but Irwin didn’t survive. His sudden death shocked the world and left millions of fans upset for the loss of a man who was truly passionate about the natural world."
