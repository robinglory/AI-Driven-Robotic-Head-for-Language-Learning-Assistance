      "title": "What Counts as Cheating?",
      "text": "Anyone who loves sports will agree that cheating is bad. For example, it was wrong for Spain to include players who were not actually disabled in the 2000 Sydney Paralympics basketball team. However, sometimes it is hard to decide what is cheating and what is not. Many sports encourage players to be 'sporting' – to play honestly and accept losing. But the rewards for winning can be great, so it is natural for players to find different ways to win. Sometimes they bend the rules or cheat to get an advantage."

      "title": "Gamesmanship",
      "text": "Gamesmanship is when you try to win by bending the rules or using doubtful tactics. For example, at the 2012 Olympics, British cyclist Philip Hindes had a bad start in a team race. Knowing that if a rider fell early the race would be restarted, he crashed his bike on purpose. Britain went on to win gold."

    {
      "id": "C",
      "title": "Psychological Tactics",
      "text": "Other examples of gamesmanship include faking injuries or wasting time. This can give players a rest or annoy their opponents, affecting their concentration. At the 2016 Rio Olympics, badminton player Carolina Marins shouted every time her opponent made a mistake. This upset her opponent, but Marins won gold without breaking any rules."

    {
      "id": "D",
      "title": "The Role of Referees",
      "text": "In unclear situations, it is the referee’s job to decide if cheating is happening. Players can take advantage because referees can’t see everything. For example, in cricket, if the ball hits a batter’s legs, he is out. Most batters know when they are out, but they often wait for the umpire’s decision in case it goes in their favour. This is not considered cheating."

      "text": "In the 1986 World Cup, Diego Maradona scored a goal with his hand. The referee didn’t see it, and Maradona didn’t admit it. In contrast, in the 2002 World Cup, Rivaldo faked an injury but was caught and fined."
