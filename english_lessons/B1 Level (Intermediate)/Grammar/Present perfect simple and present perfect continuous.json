  "title": "Present Perfect Simple vs Present Perfect Continuous",
  "summary": "This lesson explains the differences between the present perfect simple and the present perfect continuous tenses, focusing on form, duration, recent results, and usage with dynamic vs stative verbs.",
  "content": [
    "Present perfect simple is used for past actions or experiences when time is not mentioned and for ongoing situations with stative verbs.",
    "Present perfect continuous is used for actions that started in the past and are still happening or have recently stopped, usually with dynamic (action) verbs.",
    "Present perfect simple is formed with 'have/has + past participle'; present perfect continuous is formed with 'have/has been + verb-ing'.",
    "Use present perfect continuous to emphasise the duration of an action or a repeated process.",
    "Use present perfect simple to talk about completed actions or results of finished actions.",
    "Use present perfect continuous for ongoing processes with visible results (e.g., dirty hands from painting).",
    "Use present perfect simple to count how many/much; use continuous to describe how long something has been happening."
