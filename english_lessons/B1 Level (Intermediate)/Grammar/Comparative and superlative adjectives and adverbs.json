  "title": "Comparative and Superlative Adjectives and Adverbs",
  "summary": "This lesson teaches how to compare people, things, and actions using comparative and superlative forms of adjectives and adverbs. It explains the use of structures like 'more', 'less', 'as...as', and rules for modifying adverbs.",
  "content": [
    "Use the comparative form of adjectives to compare two things.",
    "Use the superlative form to compare more than two things.",
    "'Less + adjective + than' is the opposite of 'more'.",
    "Use 'as...as' or 'not as...as' to show similarity or difference.",
    "You can use object or subject pronouns after 'than' or 'as...as'.",
    "Modifiers like 'much', 'a lot', 'a bit', 'any', and 'no' can change the strength of comparatives.",
    "Use 'in' or 'of' after superlatives to indicate the group or context.",
    "Superlatives are often used with the present perfect + 'ever'.",
    "Use 'the', a possessive, or a name before the superlative.",
    "Use 'the least' as the opposite of 'the most'.",
    "Adverbs can also take comparative and superlative forms.",
    "Adverbs ending in '-ly' use 'more'/'most'; some short adverbs follow adjective rules."
