  "summary": "This lesson explains how to use 'can', 'could', and 'be able to' to talk about ability, possibility, permission, and requests. It also covers their correct forms across different tenses and common mistakes.",
  "content": [
    "'Can' and 'could' are used to describe ability and possibility in the present and past.",
    "'Can' and 'could' are also used for permission and making requests.",
    "Sense verbs (see, smell, hear, etc.) are used with 'can', not in continuous forms.",
    "'Be able to' is often used instead of 'can' for all other tenses like future, infinitive, gerund, and perfect.",
    "For specific events in the past, use 'was/were able to' or 'managed to', not just 'could'."
