  "title": "Must / Mustn’t / Have to / Don’t Have to – Obligation and Advice",
  "summary": "This lesson explains how to use 'must', 'mustn't', 'have to', and 'don't have to' for expressing obligation, prohibition, and advice. It also covers the use of 'should', 'ought to', and differences between these modal expressions.",
  "content": [
    "'Have to' is not an auxiliary verb. Use 'do/does/did' for questions and negatives.",
    "'Have to' expresses obligation or rules; it can be used in all verb forms.",
    "'Must' is a modal verb with only present form and is used for strong internal obligation or advice.",
    "'Mustn’t' means prohibition (something is not allowed).",
    "'Don’t have to' means no obligation (you can do it, but it's not necessary).",
    "'Should' and 'ought to' express advice or opinion and are weaker than 'must' or 'have to'."

  "tips": [
    "Use 'must' for strong advice or personal obligation.",
