  "summary": "This lesson explains when to use the articles 'a', 'an', and 'the', and when no article is needed in English. It provides rules and examples for each usage, including general, specific, and exceptional cases.",
  "content": [
    "'A' and 'an' are used when mentioning something for the first time, for types or kinds, to mean 'one', and in rates or expressions like 'what a...'.",
    "'The' is used when referring to something specific or already mentioned, or when there's only one of something.",
    "No article is used for general ideas, names of meals, some institutions (like school, bed, hospital), TV as a broadcasting service, and many place names.",
    "We use 'a' before consonant sounds and 'an' before vowel sounds.",
    "We cannot use singular countable nouns alone – they need an article or determiner.",
    "'The' is used with superlatives and with specific locations like oceans, rivers, and known buildings.",
    "Use 'no article' when referring to concepts generally or when the noun is uncountable or plural."
