    "Common with adverbs like just, already, yet, recently, never, ever, before.",
    "Used with unfinished time expressions (e.g. today, this week, this year).",
    "Used to express life experiences and superlatives with 'ever'.",
    "Describes how many times something has happened up to now.",
    "Used with 'for', 'since', and 'how long' to show duration from past to present.",
    "'Has gone to' means someone is still away; 'has been to' means someone has returned.",
    "Cannot be used with 'ago'.",
