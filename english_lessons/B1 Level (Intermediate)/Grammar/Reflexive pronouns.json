  "content": [
    "Reflexive pronouns are: myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves.",

    "Reflexive pronouns can follow prepositions when referring back to the subject.",

    "Use 'by myself', 'by yourself', etc., to mean alone or without help.",
    "You can also use 'on my own', 'on your own', etc., with similar meaning.",
    "Reciprocal pronouns 'each other' and 'one another' are used when two or more people do the same action to each other."
