Words with prepositions
Prepositions typically come before nouns or pronouns, helping to express aspects like time, location, direction, and more within a sentence. In English, sometimes specific words like adjectives or verbs are used with certain prepositions. It’s important to remember these combinations because they help us express ideas more accurately.

Adjectives + Prepositions
Some prepositions usually follow particular adjectives. For example, the preposition that we should use after the word good or bad is at: “Tom is good at football.” When you are learning a new word, it’s useful to use an example sentence and learn the preposition that goes with that word along with the word. Let’s explore a few more examples of adjective + preposition:

I was surprised at the news.
Alice is interested in art.
We are excited about our holiday.
I was disappointed with our meal.
Verbs + Prepositions
Just like with adjectives, there are also certain prepositions that follow certain verbs. For example, we use the preposition in after the verb arrive when we are talking about arriving in a city, town or country: “We arrived in Rome yesterday.” And when we talk about arriving at a specific place, we use the preposition at: “I arrived at the station at noon.” When you’re learning new verbs, it’s a good idea to see how they work with specific prepositions. Using example sentences can help you remember these combinations better. Let’s take a look at some more examples of verb + preposition:

I asked the man for directions.
They didn’t invite us to the party.
I’m waiting for Tom.
We spent all the money on a trip.
