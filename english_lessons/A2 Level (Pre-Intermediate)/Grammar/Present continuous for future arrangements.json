  "title": "Present Continuous for Future Arrangements",
  "summary": "This lesson explains how to use the present continuous tense to talk about future plans and arrangements, and compares it with 'be going to' and 'will'.",
  "content": [
    "The present continuous can describe future arrangements when time and place are decided.",
    "It's commonly used with travel verbs and meeting people, with future time expressions.",
    "While similar to 'be going to', it emphasizes fixed arrangements rather than intentions.",
    "'Will' remains the correct choice for instant decisions made at the moment of speaking."
