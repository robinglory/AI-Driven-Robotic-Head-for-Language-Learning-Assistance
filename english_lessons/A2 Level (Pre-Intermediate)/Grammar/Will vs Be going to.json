  "content": [
    "Both 'will' and 'be going to' can express future actions but with different meanings.",
    "'Will' is used for predictions based on opinion and instant decisions.",
    "'Be going to' is used for predictions based on evidence and pre-made plans.",
    "The choice between them depends on the context and the speaker's intention."

          "rule": "When both are possible (with slight difference in meaning)",
          "examples": [
            "The conference starts in 10 minutes. We are going to be late. (visible evidence)",
            "We need to hurry up. We'll be late for the conference. (personal opinion)"

  "tips": [
    "Use 'will' when you're making a promise, offer, or instant decision",
    "Use 'be going to' when you can see the future event coming (evidence)",
    "For personal plans you've already made, use 'be going to'",
    "In informal speech, 'going to' often becomes 'gonna'",
    "Remember: 'will' doesn't change form ('he will', not 'he wills')",
    "Negative forms: 'won't' vs 'not going to'"

  "common_errors": [
    "Incorrect: 'I think it's going to rain tomorrow.' (no evidence) Correct: 'I think it will rain tomorrow.'",
    "Incorrect: 'Look at those clouds! It will rain!' Correct: 'Look at those clouds! It's going to rain!'",
    "Incorrect: 'I'll study medicine next year.' (pre-planned) Correct: 'I'm going to study medicine next year.'"
