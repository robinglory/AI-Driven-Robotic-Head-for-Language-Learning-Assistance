  "title": "Word Order in Questions",
  "summary": "Infographic explaining the word order in English questions, with examples for standard question order and questions using the auxiliary verb 'be'.",
  "content": [
    "If we want to ask a question in English, the order is QWASM: Question word, Auxiliary verb, Subject, Main verb. In Yes-No questions, there is no Question Word.",
    "When 'be' is the main verb, it is used as the Auxiliary in the question, and then we don’t have a Main verb after the Subject.",
    "In the position of Auxiliary, we can use 'be', 'do', 'have' or any modal verb: 'can', 'could', 'will', 'would', 'should', etc.",
    "'Have' is only an auxiliary verb in the form 'have got' and in the present perfect.",
    "Have got only has a present form. It does not have a past form.",
    "We use 'how much' to ask about the price of something.",
    "We can use 'how + adjective' (any adjective) as a question word.",
    "We use 'which' when there are a small number of possible answers. Use 'what' when the number of answers is large."

  "examples": [
    "Have you got any brothers or sisters?",
    "What have you cooked for lunch?",
    "What time did you have dinner yesterday?",
    "Do you have to do it now?",
    "Which car do you like, the red or the blue?",
    "What car have you got? A Mercedes.",
    "How much is the jacket?",
    "How tall are you?",
    "How fast is your car?"
  ],
  "tips": [
    "QWASM = Question word, Auxiliary verb, Subject, Main verb.",
    "Use 'which' when the possible answers are limited. Use 'what' for general choices.",
    "‘Have got’ is only present tense. Use 'did you have' for the past."
