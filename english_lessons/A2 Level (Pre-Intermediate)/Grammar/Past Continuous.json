  "tips": [
    "Remember the structure: was/were + verb-ing",
    "Use time expressions like 'at 9 a.m.', 'at midday', 'all morning' with past continuous",
    "The past continuous often sets the background scene in stories",
    "Short interrupting actions use past simple",
    "For sequential completed actions, use past simple",
    "Be careful with -ing spelling rules (e.g., run → running, write → writing)"
