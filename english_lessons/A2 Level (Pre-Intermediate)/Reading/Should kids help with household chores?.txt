Should your kids help with household chores?
Not everyone thinks that children and teenagers should help with household chores. Some believe that asking children to help in the house teaches them important life lessons. Others feel that they should only think about school, extracurricular activities, and having fun.

From a young age, children can learn to do some small jobs around the house, like tidying up their rooms, making the bed, and setting the table. In this way, children learn that a family needs everyone’s help. They also learn to value manual work and to respect others and their work. As they grow, it feels natural for children to participate in the housework even more, such as clearing the table and washing the dishes. But it’s important to ask kids and teens to do chores that are right for their age and won’t be too hard for them. If they are doing something for the first time, they should learn how to do it first. They don’t know what to do if they don’t see it!

For children and teenagers, learning how to cook a meal, do laundry, or clean the house is an important part of growing up. It gives them confidence in their own abilities. When children and teens are responsible for some household tasks, as well as doing their homework and participating in after-school activities, they learn to organise their time better. This can be useful in every aspect of their lives.

Some people don’t agree with this idea. They think that helping with the housework might make children’s lives harder when they should just enjoy being young. Because childhood is an important part of their lives, they believe that children have other things to think about, such as studying at school, doing sports, or playing music. They worry that giving them chores might stress them out or take away from their fun time.s
